# C and Java Programming for Beginners

This GitHub repository is dedicated to teaching the basics of C and Java programming languages to all the learners out there. C and Java are two of the most popular and widely used programming languages in the world. They have many similarities and differences, and each one has its own advantages and disadvantages.

## What is C?

C is a low-level, compiled, general-purpose programming language that was developed in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. C is one of the oldest and most influential programming languages, and it is the basis for many other languages, such as C++, Java, Python, and Perl. C is mainly used for system programming, such as operating systems, drivers, compilers, and embedded systems.

## What is Java?

Java is a high-level, interpreted, object-oriented programming language that was developed in the 1990s by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages in the world, and it is designed to run on any platform that supports the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java is mainly used for application programming, such as web, mobile, desktop, and enterprise applications.

## C vs Java: A Comparison

Here are some of the main differences between C and Java:

- C is a procedural language, which means it follows a sequence of steps or instructions to perform a task. Java is an object-oriented language, which means it organizes data and behavior into classes and objects that interact with each other.
- C is a compiled language, which means it converts the source code into an executable file that can run on a specific machine. Java is an interpreted language, which means it converts the source code into bytecode that can run on any machine that has the JVM.
- C is a low-level language, which means it gives more control and access to the hardware and memory. Java is a high-level language, which means it abstracts away the details of the hardware and memory and provides more features and functionality.
- C does not have built-in support for memory management, exception handling, generics, and concurrency. Java has built-in support for these features, which makes it easier and safer to write and run programs.
- C does not have a standard library that provides common data structures and algorithms. Java has a standard library that provides a rich set of data structures and algorithms, such as arrays, lists, sets, maps, stacks, queues, sorting, searching, etc.

## C and Java Programs: Examples

Here are some examples of simple C and Java programs that demonstrate some of the basic concepts and syntax of the languages.

### C Program: Hello World

This is a C program that prints "Hello, World!" to the standard output.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

```Java
public class HelloWorld {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
